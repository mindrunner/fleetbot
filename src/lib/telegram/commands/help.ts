<b>Welcome to fleetbot!</b>
I can automatically refill your Star Atlas enlisted fleets.

Prerequisites:
- Your wallet has enlisted Ships to the Faction Fleet. You can do that on <a>https://play.staratlas.com</a>
- You have refilled your ships at least once. This creates escrow accounts for the supplies. Unfortunately, I cannot do that for you.

Last but not least, you have to send me some <b>ATLAS</b> which I will use as your credits for the supplies.

You can send it to one of the following addresses:
- <b>${config.user.address1}</b>
- <b>${config.user.address2}</b>

As soon as I receive the ATLAS, I will start refilling your ships in regular intervals. I use an optimized refilling strategy, so that you are always covered.
However, to save you on commission, I will not fully load the ship. You can always refill your fleet by yourself. I will only jump in if you are running low.

For the hard work of refilling all the fleets, I keep 15% of the ATLAS I spend for myself.
You can change the commission at any time to any value.

Bare in mind that I check the ledger in 10 minute intervals. So your deposits will be recognized by me a little bit delayed. Dont' panic. :)
